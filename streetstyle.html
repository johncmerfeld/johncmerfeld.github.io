		<h1> 6/25/17 - AI algorithm analyzes millions of Instragram photos to measure global fashion trends </h1>

		<p> Researchers at Cornell University published a <A href="http://streetstyle.cs.cornell.edu/">paper</A> this month
			detailing the results of a computer analysis of over 100 million photos uploaded to Instagram over a three-year period.
			They were able to train algorithms to identify clothing styles in the photos and quantify how fashion trends vary throughout both space and time.</p>

		<p> Computer scientists <A href="http://kmatzen.com/">Kevin Matzen</A>, <A href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~kb/">Kavita Bala</A>, and <A href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~snavely/">Noah Snavely </A>, who utilized several machine learning techniques to create a first-of-its-kind analysis of global clothing styles, colors, and patterns, say their work represents a first step toward using data mining techniques to gain insight into human culture. In particular, their aim is to tap the “tremendous cache of unstructured visual information… locked in images… including the billions of photos uploaded to photo-sharing services each day.” </p>

		<p> The broader strokes of the study’s findings can be viewed online using this <A href="http://streetstyle.cs.cornell.edu/trends.html">trend visualizer </A>. Queries to this tool demonstrate that some clothing trends are tied firmly to geography, while others are more linked to the time of year. For example, people wearing jackets appeared in 54% of photos taken in Iceland, but only 6% of those in Jamaica. On the other hand, the frequency of the color red in the United States spikes around Halloween and Christmas (particularly red hats), and a similar red spike in China accompanies the Chinese New Year. </p>
		<p> The researchers selected clothing for their analysis because fashion offers an outward expression of multiple cultural factors: individuals may decide what to wear for reasons of geography, weather, religion, social status, gender expression, and beyond. These intersections of geography and culture played out in many different ways, showing that latitude was not necessarily destiny. For example, a country-by-country look at sleeveless shirts shows that people in Greece are twice as likely as those in neighboring (and more conservative) Turkey to go without sleeves. </p>
		<p> The study’s analytics also examined “styles,” or combination of clothing attributes, and measured to what degree they were concentrated in space or time (such as yellow sports Jerseys in Bogota, Colombia during the world cup), as opposed to being universal (such as blue collared shirts and black t-shirts). </p>
