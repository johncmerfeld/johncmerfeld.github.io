This is a website for my personal portfolio. It contains a resume with some links to various projects and a short bio page. In future iterations I plan to add a more detailed list of my projects and where to find them, as well as more links to programming projects more specifically.

I used some of Ming Chow's example CSS to help troubleshoot and test my HTML, although all CSS used by the actual page was written by myself. You'll see that file is in the repo but is not used by the HTML.

Time spent working:
- ~2 hours Sunday
- ~5 hours Monday
