		<p> It’s common knowledge that diseases like Zika, Malaria, and Yellow Fever are all spread by mosquitos, while Lyme Disease is spread by ticks. But how does that actually work? What makes an organism well-suited to transmitting infections, and what can we do about the bugs that keep biting us? I talked these questions over with  <A href="http://labs.russell.wisc.edu/ento/people/faculty/paskewitz/">Dr. Susan Paskewitz</A>. She’s a public health entomologist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and she studies insects and ticks that transmit diseases to humans. I had the pleasure of interviewing her in her Madison laboratory; we discussed the increased incidence of Lyme Disease, how insights into insect biology have led to new tools for fighting the spread of parasites, and some of her research into the public's willingness to invest in pest control. </p>
