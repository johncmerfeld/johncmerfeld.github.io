		<p> This is a cover of Florence + The Machine's "Cosmic Love."
			I recorded it with two other students as a final project for
			the music recording and production class at Tufts University.
			I recorded the vocals, guitar, violin, and MIDI instruments and
			did the bulk of the mixing in Pro Tools. </p>
