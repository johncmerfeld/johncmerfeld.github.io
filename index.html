				Merfeld online experience </span></h1>

		<p> Not sure what you're doing here, friend. Maybe you're looking for the
		<A href="bio.html">bio page</A>.
		Maybe you just want to drool over my <A href="resume.html">resume page</A>.
		But I don't know. I'm not all that. </p>

		<p> Anyway, here's me. </p>

		<h2> Questions you may have at this point </h2>
		<h4> What's that behind you? </h4>
		<p> Oh, that? That's not mine. An old woman with a hook for a face
		left that here last Christmas. </p>
		<h4> Don't you think you should do something about it? It's crying. </h4>
		<p> Never you mind what it's doing or what's written on the soles of its feet.
		It feels like we're getting sidetracked. Isn't the internet amazing?</p>
		<h4> Not really. Your website doesn't even have any buttons. </h4>
		<p> Soon, friend, soon. </p>
