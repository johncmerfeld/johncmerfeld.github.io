		<p> Hello! My name is John C. Merfeld. I'm a 22-year-old physics and
		computer science student at Tufts University. I was born in Madison, Wisconsin in 1994
	 	as the youngest of four children. My passions include music, fiction writing,
	 	and the construction of useful scientific metaphors. My other interests include comedy, coding,
	 	and the great outdoors.  </p>
